# Why? How?
I had Stata syntax highlighting colour.
So I matched with that in Sublime Text 3, for seamless workflow.

To achieve that, I tweaked Tomorrow.tmTheme file.
Then renamed the file as **SK_markdown.tmTheme**.

# Where to save?
In Sublime, go to Preferences -> Browse packagesâ€¦ and this should bring up the File Explorer window. You're here:
> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\

From there, navigate further to `User/Color Highlighter/themes`. So, the full path will be:
> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\Color Highlighter\themes

In summary, save **SK_markdown.tmTheme** under :
> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\Color Highlighter\themes

# What's next?
In Sublime Text 3, go to the menu

## Preferences > Theme...
Set as Default.sublime-theme
(already set as default. Leave as it is)

## Preferences > Colour Scheme
Start typing SK.
It'll bring the file.
Select **SK_markdown.tmTheme**

# Troubleshoot
What if the file is not found? Try different locations.

> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\Colorsublime - Themes\cache\Colorsublime-Themes-master\themes

or,

> C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Sublime Text 3\Cache\User\ColorScheme

 <!-- End  -->
