## README

The files will allow you to run Stata and R code from external editors, such as Sublime Text 3, Notepad++, and Visual Studio Code.

(I linked Atom to Stata as well, but I don't really recommend Atom. The major drawback is it can be often unresponsive, and technical glitches occur too often).


## Why bother?
I often assign one task to one editor, while another editor opened with the tutorial folder. This workflow works well for me. If someone else shares my view and can be benefitted, that'd be great.

Another advantage is that external editors allow more features. I interpret this **facilitation of creative work**. The aesthetics and rich functionality motivate me. 

Finally, I just need some changes from the *default* editor. The freedom to choose an editor depending on my mood and the need greatly enhances coding experience!
