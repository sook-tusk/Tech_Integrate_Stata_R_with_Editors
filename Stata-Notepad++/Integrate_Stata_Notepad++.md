# Step 1: Install Notepad++ and Stata

Notepad++ freely available but only in Windows PC. It is not modern but it is robust.

# Step 2: Save "rundo_all"

Unzip the rundo_all.7z folder. (To unzip, you need 7-zip. Download 7-zip free here <https://www.7-zip.org/>). The folder contains both rundo and rundolines programmes. These were originally developed by Friedrich Huebler and I tweaked so that the focus is back to the editor.

All files will be placed under: `C:/ado/personal/`

To do so, in C drive, create **ado** and **personal** folders.

Then, put the unzipped files. Check your Stata version and path. These settings are defined in *rundo.ini* and *rundolines.ini* files. Open these *ini* files and customise the settings according to your system settings. See Friedrich Huebler's blog <https://huebler.blogspot.com/2008/04/stata.html> for the rest of the settings.
